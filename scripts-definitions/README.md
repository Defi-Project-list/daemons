# Scripts Definitions

This folder contains basic script objects that can be built from the data in the DB.

The goal is to have verifiable scripts, so that Storage can perform some sort of
pruning of old scripts.

Frontend can also use these scripts for verifications, but will wrap them to have
them executable as well.
